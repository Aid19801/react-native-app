i) lowerCase the dayOfWeek
2) process the API data to ONLY that day.
3)



           {gigs.map((each, i) =>

           <TouchableOpacity
             key={i}
             style={styles.textContainer}
             onPress={() => nav('GigsPage', { clickedItem: each, dayOfWeek: dayOfWeek })}
             >

             <View>
                 <Text style={styles.text}>
                   {each.gig}
                 </Text>
             </View>

           </TouchableOpacity>



         )}

CURRENT STATUS
i) we have results showing
ii) but the results that were populating grid
were the 'today!' kind of day. NOT the clickedItem kind
of day.

NEXT STEPS
Maybe re-plan containers and components.
GIGS > would pass two props (today, selectedDay, Api Data.)
GIG DAY > filter Api data, based on selectedDay
